Day 62 (73) - 45:30
===================

I think I'll start adding the total days in parentheses, counting
the missed days since I started again, but not the intentional 9.5
week break.

10:00 NGSL top 150 @ 23 WPM.

Hrm. A bunch of those don't have translation hints.

OK. Productive day today. Jason and I improved the appearance of
the stroke display by shifting the vowels down and inward. I
smoothed out the scrolling quite a bit. And I wrote a script to
find all the bad translations in `plover-translations.js`. So on
that note I think I'll do one more round of drill and go to bed.

10:00 - NGSL top 500 root words @ 22 WPM.

Or rather, a random selection of about 220 of them.

0:20 today, 45:50 total.
